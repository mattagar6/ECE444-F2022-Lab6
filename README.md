## Pros and Cons of Test-Driven Development (Part 3 of Lab)
A pro of TDD is it forces you as a developer to think of your project at a higher level, about the arctitechture, 
possible features, and what you want the user experience to be like BEFORE you even start writing the code. By writing the 
tests first, you set the exact specifications (inputs/outputs/features) of your system before you start coding. This allows 
you to only focus on the implementation details, rather than higher-level architechture when you start developing features. 

A con of TDD is that it can slow down the pace of development, and sometimes you have to write 2x as much code for trivial tests.
There is a balance in knowing what features to test, and what to not test. Overdoing the number of tests for trivail code is not productive 
for developers.
